How to Run the Application
Clone the repository:
git clone <repo-url>
Open project folder
Run:
dotnet run
Follow the menu to manage employees
Notes
Ensure SQLite is installed properly.
Verify the database file Employee.db exists in the project directory.
The console app will continue running until the user selects Exit.

Project Summary
The Employee Management Application is a fully functional C# console program demonstrating strong object-oriented design and proper database integration. It features inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and composition through multiple employee types and reusable components. The application stores records in SQLite and provides a clean CRUD menu for interacting with the data. Over multiple weeks, I expanded the application using Agile techniques while incrementally improving design, functionality, and reliability. This project showcases my ability to build a structured application, manage version control in GitHub, document development, and integrate software engineering concepts into a working solution.
